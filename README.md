# Search Engines Blocked in Header

---

A simple WordPress plugin that displays a red-colored admin bar notice labeled **"Search Engines Discouraged"** if your site is set to discourage search engine indexing.

---

## Description

The **Search Engines Blocked in Header** plugin enhances your WordPress admin experience by providing a clear and highly visible notice in the admin toolbar whenever the `blog_public` setting is disabled — meaning your site is not visible to search engines.

### Why this matters

This setting is often used during development or maintenance phases, but it’s easy to forget it’s enabled. This plugin makes sure that setting doesn't go unnoticed.
